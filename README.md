1. **How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**
To ensure that my code is functional and secure, I implement a comprehensive testing strategy, which includes unit testing, integration testing, and code reviews. By writing unit tests for each feature, such as the contact service in Project One, I can verify that each component works as intended. Additionally, I adopt security best practices, such as input validation and sanitization, to mitigate vulnerabilities. Regular code reviews with peers play a crucial role in identifying potential security issues and ensuring adherence to coding standards, thereby maintaining the security of the software.

2. **How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**
Interpreting user needs begins with gathering requirements through discussions, surveys, or stakeholder interviews. I used user stories and requirements documents to clarify necessary functionalities in my projects. For example, in developing the contact service, I focused on essential features such as adding, updating, and deleting contacts directly informed by user input. I then incorporated these needs into the software design and development process to ensure the final product meets user expectations.

3. **How do I approach designing software?**
My approach to designing software starts with a thorough understanding of the project requirements and user needs. I utilize design patterns that fit the problem domain, ensuring scalability and maintainability. For instance, in my project, I used object-oriented principles to design the Contact and ContactService classes, which helped encapsulate related functionalities. This systematic approach, coupled with the use of design patterns, helps me ensure a coherent and organized codebase.
